# fireemblemgauntletchecker
A python script I created to get the scores of various teams for the Fire Emblem Heroes Voting Gauntlet. The script scrapes an online html document using BeautifulSoup package and converts that into data that tells the user whether a certain team is winning. It isn't actually complete yet, and it should be run on a Raspberry Pi except the Pi can't connect to the internet due to Northeastern WiFi not allowing that. :(
